# Service Compliance Audit Against .docs Standards

> ⚠️ **HISTORICAL — SUPERSEDED BY THE MODULAR REFACTOR.** This is a point-in-time audit (2026-02-03)
> of the **pre-refactor layered layout** (`internal/app/services`), which no longer exists. Code is now
> organized by business module under `internal/modules/<name>/` — see **[MODULE_GUIDE.md](./MODULE_GUIDE.md)**
> (source of truth). Each module's business logic now lives in `service.go` (split further when needed,
> e.g. auth's `service.go` + `service_tokens.go`) and defines the repository interface it consumes in-package.
> **The findings below remain valid** — the modular services are still struct-based with DI, avoid
> `gin.Context` (except the documented DataTables exception), go through a repository, wrap errors, and stay
> within size limits — but the **paths and file names refer to the old layout.** Old → new mapping for the
> items audited here:
>
> | Audited (pre-refactor) | Now (modular) |
> |------------------------|----------------|
> | `internal/app/services/auth/` (`auth_service.go`, `auth_service_tokens.go`) | `internal/modules/auth/` (`service.go`, `service_tokens.go`) |
> | `internal/app/services/example_service.go` | `internal/modules/example/service.go` |
> | `internal/app/services/health_service.go` | `internal/modules/health/service.go` |
>
> The two-file split for auth (logic + tokens) was preserved through the refactor. This document is
> preserved as history; do not treat its paths as current guidance.

**Audit date:** 2026-02-03

## Summary of Standards Applicable to Services

| Source | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **00_AI TIER 0** | Service MUST be struct-based with methods; DI via constructor (`New*`). |
| **00_AI TIER 1** | File max 300 lines; function max 100 lines. |
| **AI_AGENT_RULES** | Document all exported symbols; errors must be handled (no `_, _`); tests in `tests/`; minimum 70% coverage for services. |
| **CODING_STANDARDS §3** | Service: all business logic; orchestrate repository; business validation; data transform. Service MUST NOT: handle HTTP (`gin.Context`), import controller, exceed 400 lines per file. |
| **DESIGN_PATTERNS** | Service MUST NOT: handle HTTP (`gin.Context`), access DB directly (use repository), import controller, return HTTP response. Max 100 lines per function; max 400 lines per file (conservative: 300 per global rule). |

**File size:** Strict project limit = **300 lines** (AI_AGENT_RULES, 5 Commandments). DESIGN_PATTERNS mentions 400 for service files; for consistency we use **300 lines** as the target.

**Subfolder when split:** If a single service is split into more than one file, all files for that feature **MUST** be moved to a subfolder (e.g. `services/auth/`) with package name = folder (e.g. `package auth`). See CODING_STANDARDS §1.1 (File Size Limits).

## Status per Service

### 1. AuthService (`internal/app/services/auth/`)

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Struct-based + DI | Yes | `AuthService` struct, `NewAuthService()` |
| Does not use `gin.Context` | Yes | Only `context.Context` + DTO |
| Does not access DB directly | Yes | All via `repositories.*` |
| Errors handled, wrapped with context | Yes | `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`, `logger.Errorf` |
| Exported documented | Yes | Godoc for struct, New*, and all public methods |
| File size | Yes | After changes: `auth_service.go` ~285 lines, `auth_service_tokens.go` ~195 lines (both ≤300). |
| Function size | Yes | No function >100 lines |

**Completed:** AuthService split into two files and **moved to subfolder** `services/auth/`: `auth_service.go` (Register, Login, ValidateToken + helpers) and `auth_service_tokens.go` (RefreshToken, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword + generatePasswordResetToken). Package = `auth`; callers use `auth.NewAuthService()` and `*auth.AuthService`.

---

### 2. ExampleService (`internal/app/services/example_service.go`)

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Struct-based + DI | Yes | `ExampleService` struct, `NewExampleService()` |
| Does not use `gin.Context` | Exception | `GetDataDatatables(ctx, c *gin.Context)` accepts `gin.Context` because the DataTables-Gin library requires `c` for binding query params. Exception documented in § Service Exceptions (below). |
| Does not access DB directly | Yes | GetData via `repositories.Get`; GetDataDatatables via `repositories.GetDataDatatables(c)` (repo accesses DB). |
| Errors handled | Yes | GetData and GetDataDatatables return errors; none ignored |
| Exported documented | Yes | Godoc for struct, New*, GetData, GetDataDatatables |
| File/function size | Yes | File ~51 lines; each function <100 lines |

**Conclusion:** ExampleService complies with standards with one documented exception: DataTables method accepts `gin.Context` for third-party library integration.

---

### 3. HealthService (`internal/app/services/health_service.go`)

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Struct-based + DI | Yes | `HealthService` struct, `NewHealthService()` |
| Does not use `gin.Context` | Yes | Only `context.Context` |
| Does not access DB directly | Minor | `checkDatabase()` calls `database.DB` for ping. Strict layering would require a "health repository"; in practice health checks often allow direct DB access for ping. Accepted with note. |
| Errors handled | Yes | Ping errors logged and return status "error" |
| Exported documented | Yes | Godoc for struct, New*, CheckHealth, GetMetrics |
| File/function size | Yes | File ~91 lines; each function <100 lines |

**Conclusion:** HealthService complies with standards. Use of `database.DB` in `checkDatabase()` for ping is an accepted layering exception for health checks.

---

## Documented Exceptions

### Service Accepting `gin.Context` (ExampleService.GetDataDatatables)

- **General rule:** Service MUST NOT handle HTTP concerns (`gin.Context`).
- **Exception:** `ExampleService.GetDataDatatables(ctx, c *gin.Context)` accepts `*gin.Context` because the **Datatables-Gin** library (`datatables.OfReturn(c, query, ...)`) requires `*gin.Context` to read query params (draw, start, length, search, order, etc.). Moving binding to the controller would require duplicating the entire DataTables API into DTOs and is not natively supported by the library.
- **Documentation:** This exception is recorded in CODING_STANDARDS §11 (API Design) so that code review does not reject on the grounds of "service must not use gin.Context".

---

## Action Summary

| Service | Action | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| AuthService | Split files — `auth_service.go` + `auth_service_tokens.go` | Done |
| ExampleService | Exception for `gin.Context` in GetDataDatatables documented in this doc + CODING_STANDARDS | Documented |
| HealthService | No change; DB access for ping accepted | OK |

---

## Post-fix Checklist

- [x] AuthService: two files, each ≤300 lines.
- [x] CODING_STANDARDS: added paragraph on service exception (DataTables + gin.Context).
- [x] Build and test: `go build ./...` and `go test ./tests/...` pass.
